LayeredAspects (LA)

  (1) Code locality - (medium)
    + driver code localized
    - pointcuts related to around in Quote should be 
      redifined/duplicated in QuoteDynamic (they are duplicated in two places).
      
  (2) Reusability - (low)
      + The adviceexecution used in the LA idiom is reused since it 
        applies to all advice to check the driver condition.
      - but the redifined ptc refer to specific feature join points that are 
        used by specific around advice.
      - so, redifined ptc cannot be reused to all applications. Hence, compromising
        the overall idiom reusability.
        
   (3) Changeability - (low)
      - All pointcuts defined in Quote (for example) need to be redefined in QuoteDynamic.
      - If the application is being modified to support different binding time with LA, we
        need to change the aspect code related to the feature modularization (like Quote) to
        support the pointcut redefinition. As a result, all the pointcuts to be redefined needs
        to be redefined in QuoteDynamic. This requires a lot of change.
        
   (4) Plugabbility - (yes)
       + We just need to remove the QuoteDynamic from the build.
       
   (5) Code instrumentation/Overhead (high)
        - The adviceexecution intercepts/instruments more than necessary. It instruments
          all the advice in the application. But the around advice is already handled by the
          redefined pointcuts (ptc). This lead us to an overhead in the execution time as well.
