Drawbacks (LayeredAspects):

 - The empty concrete aspect for static BT is mandatory to enable the feature code. 
 - The adviceexecution idiom is not generic enough
   - It is mandatory to redine all pointcuts related to around advice explicitly declared
     in the abstract aspect.
 
 - Overhead in source code/bytecode instrumentation and performance.
    - The adviceexecution idiom does not exclude non-around advice from feature activation/deactivation.
      They are performed by the if pointcuts provided by the redefined pointcuts.
      So we have a "double check" problem that need to be optimized.
